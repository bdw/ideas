Continue work on the TLS modules
================================

Description
-----------

Continue the work on the TLS modules. It would be awesome If OpenSSL (with IO::Socket::SSL and IO::Socket::Async::SSL) were feature complete, because IMHO sometimes enterprise companties need agree on some TLS specification. This would offer a consitent API for modules like Cro and others.
